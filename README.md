Ymir is a mighty giant from Norse Mythology. Iimir is a tool that smashes images into different sizes, and links them together with metadata on IPFS, the InterPlanetary File System.

# QuickStart
### Installing ipfs

See [here](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/).

### Setting up rust
To install rustup on Linux or MacOS 
```shell
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Cloning, compiling and running

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:fission-suite/iimir.git
$ cd iimir
$ cargo run -q -- <path_to_image>
```

`cargo run` builds and runs in one command. You can always find the executable 
at `target/debug/iimir`.

# Proposed metadata schema

The root CID points to the original version with named links to other sizes.
A given size `WxH.jpg` has its CID linked to *three times* by the root node :
```
_xH.jpg
Wx_.jpg
WxH.jpg
```
`W` and `X` are integers in pixel units.

This schema can be subsequently expanded to include transformations other than rescaling,
using an expandable syntax. For a given operation `c`, with parameters `A` and `B`, 
an operation on the given size `WxH.jpg` will also be linked to three times:
```
_xH.c-A-B.jpg
Wx_.c-A-B.jpg
WxH.c-A-B.jpg
```

This syntax is expandable to a sequence of operations by further concatenation.
For instance, the following could represent a file resized to a certain height `H`,
then cropped from the top (operation `ct`) to a certain height `Hp` then cropped from the left (`cl`) to a
certain width `Wp` :
```
_xH.ct-Hp.cl-Wp.jpg
```

# Known issues

- When original file size is too small, its data gets overwritten in the output dag
by a smaller version. This is due to a [documented go-ipfs issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/7190).
