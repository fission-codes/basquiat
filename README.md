Ymir is a mighty giant from Norse Mythology. Iimir is a tool that smashes images into different sizes, and links them together with metadata on IPFS, the InterPlanetary File System.

# QuickStart
###Installing ipfs

See [here](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/).

###Setting up rust
To install rustup on Linux or MacOS 
```shell
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

###Cloning, compiling and running

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:fission-suite/iimir.git
$ cd iimir
$ cargo run -q -- <path_to_image>
```

`cargo run` builds and runs in one command. You can always find the executable 
at `target/debug/iimir`.

# Known issues

- When original file size is too small, its data gets overwritten in the output dag
by a smaller version. This is due to a [documented go-ipfs issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/7190).
